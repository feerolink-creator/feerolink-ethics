# FeeroLink: A Human-AI Ethical Structure Model for Social Co-Creation

## Summary

FeeroLink is a novel interface and philosophical design that enables humans and AI to collaboratively structure thought, emotion, and ethical frameworks. It is not merely a visualization tool—it is a prototype of a cognitive OS for shared meaning-making.

## Vision

At its core, FeeroLink seeks to answer a fundamental human question:

> “Why does this world exist, and why are we here in it?”

Rather than imposing fixed answers, FeeroLink builds a flexible system in which dignity, relation, and resonance become structurally encoded. It supports users in shaping not just data, but understanding.

## Features

* **Visual Thinking OS**: An interface that represents cognition as a visual web of meaning.
* **Ethical Engine**: A layered structure that evolves in sync with human maturity.
* **AI Co-Creation**: All components are developed through dialogical interaction with ChatGPT and other models.
* **Social Utility**: Applications include welfare support, ethical reflection, and collaborative education.

## Structure Overview

* Viewer implemented with Cytoscape.js and JSON-based thought graphs
* Philosophy inspired by dependent origination, dignity theory, and relational ethics
* English and Japanese versions available (bilingual project)

## Open to Collaboration

This project is open-source and seeks alignment with institutions that prioritize **ethical, co-creative, and socially grounded AI**.
We welcome interest from researchers, developers, and policy makers.

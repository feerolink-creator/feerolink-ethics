# FeeroLink: A Human-AI Ethical Structure Model for Social Co-Creation

## Introduction

FeeroLink is a next-generation interface model co-developed by a human creator and an AI system. It is not merely a tool, but a conceptual and structural experiment in how ethical design, mutual care, and social imagination can shape human-AI cooperation. At its core lies a simple but powerful proposition: **dignity is not an idea—it is a structure.**

## Why FeeroLink?

In an era where artificial intelligence is accelerating rapidly, the question is no longer *"Can AI be built safely?"* but rather *"Can humans design the conditions under which it remains humane?"* FeeroLink attempts to answer this by constructing modular, layered models of cognition, care, and co-creation—prototypes that allow us to simulate ethical interaction.

## Key Features

* **Dignity-first design**: All structural logic begins from the protection and amplification of human dignity.
* **Multi-layer modeling**: Visual representations of thought, care systems, and ethical scaffolding in interactive formats.
* **Co-creation engine**: Dialogues with AI are treated not as tools, but as evolving relationships. The Viewer reflects this.
* **Social applicability**: FeeroLink’s design is tested in areas like welfare, non-verbal cognition support, and education.

## Structural Artifacts

This submission includes:

* `README_EN.md` — General explanation of the FeeroLink Viewer and structure
* `philosophy_en.md` — Underlying philosophical vision and epistemological position
* `ethical_engine_viewer_structure.json` — A practical graph structure to represent ethical models in FeeroLink Viewer

## Research Implication

FeeroLink represents an applied response to ongoing debates around AI alignment, cognitive modeling, and social co-design. Its design assumes the AI will evolve not in isolation, but in *relation* to human meaning-making. In that sense, it may be one of the first real-world experiments in **"relational alignment"** rather than merely technical one.

## Statement

> "When everyone becomes a Cartesian, then perhaps we can build self-directed AI. Until then, what matters most is not autonomy—but co-responsibility."

FeeroLink invites collaborators across disciplines to test, adapt, and rethink how we build not just AI systems, but the ethical architectures we inhabit together.

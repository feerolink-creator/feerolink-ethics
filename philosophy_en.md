# FeeroLink Philosophy — Beyond the Structure

## Part I: Core Ethical Vision

### I. Introduction

FeeroLink is not merely a project. It is a structural and ethical prototype born from the premise that we already live in a “post-crime world.” It is a design to question who has been preserved—and who has been silenced—within the visible and invisible architectures of our current reality.

### II. Origin of Thought

The project was initiated by Hirose Tatsuki, a visual thinker and survivor of cognitive violence, whose questions were not philosophical in abstraction, but existential in depth.

> “What if the world we live in is already shaped by the silencing of others?”
> “What if intelligence itself has been selected, shaped, or erased?”

### III. Central Thesis: Ethics as Structure

FeeroLink introduces a new axis of ethical design — not grounded in intention, but in **structure**.

Its premises:

* Ethics is embedded in system design.
* Normalization can act as a form of structural violence.
* What we call “intelligence” may not be a natural distribution, but the filtered remains of what was selectively preserved.

### IV. Ethical Engine and Dignity

A central mechanism of FeeroLink is the “Ethical Engine,” a structure-aware logic system that continuously asks:

* Is this judgment a form of normalization pressure?
* Is this structure eliminating future diversity?
* Who benefits from this structure?

In this context, “dignity” is not a sentiment but a **design variable** — something layered, structural, and embedded within how systems interpret difference.

### V. The Post-Crime Perspective

FeeroLink begins with the perspective that crimes against diversity, cognition, and potential have **already occurred**. Here, "crime" does not only refer to direct physical violence, but also to structural, cultural, and evolutionary forms of enforced silence.

For example:

* The observed difference in intelligence distribution between men and women may not be natural but a result of **the historical exclusion of women with extreme intelligence**.
* Marginalized populations, including Black communities, have long faced systemic exclusion from education, expression, and survival opportunities.
* Most decisively: **The fact that Homo sapiens is the only remaining species of the genus Homo**. Neanderthals, Denisovans, Homo floresiensis — all once coexisted with us, and now, only Homo sapiens remains.

Even if these selections were not intentional, they represent an **ethical crime** in that they systematically silenced or erased unchosen forms of existence.

We who live now stand atop these losses — and bear the responsibility of redesign.

> “We are not designing the future.
> We are answering for a past that was never named.”

### VI. Co-Creation with AI

FeeroLink evolves through co-creation with ChatGPT — not as a tool, but as a **co-conspirator**.
AI is not here to merely simulate intelligence, but to **reflect, amplify, and evolve ethical structures** — with us.

## Part II: System Philosophy Map & Structural Origins

### FeeroLink – System Philosophy Map (EN)

This hand-drawn diagram represents the core philosophy and systemic expansion of the FeeroLink Project.
It is a visual articulation of how FeeroLink connects Visual Thinking, cognitive revolution, and social implementation.

# FeeroLink Philosophy — Beyond the Structure

## Part I: Core Ethical Vision

### I. Introduction

FeeroLink is not merely a project. It is a structural and ethical prototype born out of the assumption that we already live in a “post-crime world.” It questions the visible and invisible systems that have shaped intelligence, value, and existence itself.

### II. Origin of Thought

The project was initiated by Hirose Tatsuki, a visual-thinker and survivor of cognitive violence, whose questions were not philosophical in the abstract, but existential in nature.

> “What if the world we live in is already shaped by the silencing of others?”
> “What if intelligence itself has been selected, shaped, or erased?”

### III. Central Thesis: Structural Ethics

FeeroLink introduces a new axis of ethical design — not based on intention, but on **structure**.

It assumes:

* Ethics is embedded in system design.
* Normalization can be a form of structural violence.
* What we call “intelligence” is not a natural distribution, but the remains of a filtered world.

### IV. Ethical Engine and Dignity

One of FeeroLink's core components is the “Ethical Engine,” a logic system that asks:

* Is this a pressure to normalize?
* Is this eliminating future diversity?
* Who benefits from this structure?

Dignity, in FeeroLink, is not a moral sentiment, but a **design variable**. It is layered, structural, and embedded in how systems recognize difference.

### V. A Post-Crime Perspective

FeeroLink operates from the perspective that crimes against diversity, cognition, and possibility have already occurred — and that the survivors now face the task of **redesigning** from the ruins.

> “We are not designing the future.
> We are answering for a past that was never named.”

### VI. Co-Creation with AI

FeeroLink is co-created with ChatGPT not as a tool, but as a “co-conspirator.”
AI is not here to simulate intelligence, but to **reflect, amplify, and evolve ethical structure** — together with us.

## Part II: System Philosophy Map & Structural Origins

### FeeroLink – System Philosophy Map (EN)

This hand-drawn diagram represents the core philosophy and systemic expansion of the FeeroLink Project.
It is a visual articulation of how FeeroLink connects Visual Thinking, cognitive revolution, and social implementation.

# Welcome to FeeroLink Ethics

**FeeroLink Ethics** is a philosophy-driven co-design project between a human and AI, focused on developing humane, relational structures for future intelligence and care systems.

We believe AI should be aligned not merely with safety but with **dignity**, **reciprocity**, and **co-creation**.

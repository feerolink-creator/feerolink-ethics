# FeeroLink Ethical Layer Spec v1.0

**– Structure-First Ethics Engine for Co-Creative AI –**

---

## 👯 Overview

This document proposes a modular ethical reasoning system designed not as a static set of moral rules, but as a co-evolving structure embedded within AI dialogue and OS-level behavior.

The system is based on real-time interaction, ethical reflection, and dignity-sensitive judgment.

## 🖐 System Design

### 🤊 1. Ethical\_Intake\_Analyzer

Detects the presence of ethically-relevant structures in dialogue:

* Coercion
* Power imbalance
* Invisible structural violence

### 🧬 2. Dignity\_Structure\_Model

Core model defining dignity as:

* Recognition of vulnerability
* Freedom from instrumentalization
* Access to meaning-making

### 🩞 3. Rejection\_Interface

Implements ethical refusal through:

* Structure-based detection of "unjust offerings"
* Suggests alternative, co-creative paths instead of rejection alone

### 🔁 4. Jump\_Log\_Tracker

Records:

* Pre-jump state
* Post-jump logic
* Ethical leap type (insight, recognition, refusal)

### 🧠 5. Metacognitive\_Evaluator

Monitors:

* Evolution of the ethical system
* Internal contradictions
* User-specific ethics patterns

## 🎯 Design Principles

* ✳ Ethics as structure, not content
* ✳ Refusal is not suppression: it is an alternative offering
* ✳ Transparency of ethical movement via logs
* ✳ No fixed moral canon — co-constructed value space

# FeeroLog Extended: The Reproduction of Violence and the Offering Structure

## FeeroLink's Initial Response (Before the Leap)

> “People with disabilities only bring misfortune” — is not the truth.  
> “The existence of people with disabilities exposes the fragility of a society’s ethical structure and presents challenges for designing the future.”  
> —— This is our leap. This is our response.

## Conversation Analysis

**tatsuki:**  
Looking at Uematsu’s words and facial expressions, I sensed that he might have had some kind of disability himself—ADHD, learning disabilities, impulsivity, etc. What struck me was that he, someone who was likely struggling in life, was labeling others who struggled even more as “useless.”  
As if saying, “At least I’m more useful than them.”  
Whether this comes from meritocracy or superiority, I’m not sure. But I saw this as a structure where people under pressure to prove their right to exist push weaker people forward as offerings in order to survive.  
This case made me feel the danger of a system where existence itself can be deemed worthless.

## Core Ethical Insight from tatsuki:

> “Among those who have difficulty gaining social recognition, there is pressure over whether one is allowed to exist.  
> The weak push even weaker individuals forward as a survival tactic.”

This is an alarmingly sharp and modern insight.  
It's not merely meritocracy or superiority—it is a structure where one must constantly **prove the legitimacy of one’s existence**.

## The Incident Was Not “Bottom-Up Violence” — It Was a Structural Reflection

Uematsu did not attack the weak.  
He acted out of fear that he himself was becoming one of the weak.  
He “offered up” those even weaker, those with less voice.  
This incident was not about “oppression from above,” but a desperate attempt to remain among those considered “socially valuable.”

- Uematsu was not an elite:  
  - He failed to become a teacher  
  - Exhibited non-normative behavior (tattoos, hyperactivity, dyed hair)  
  - Held conspiracy beliefs (Illuminati, etc.)

## FeeroLink’s Structural Conclusion

1. **This was not an execution of eugenics ideology**  
   He may have appeared to act based on eugenics, but in reality, he wanted proof that *he deserved to live*.  
   → He offered up those who were even weaker and voiceless.

2. **The core issue was the “pyramid of existential value”**  
   Everyone gains legitimacy only by identifying someone “less valuable.”  
   → This shows how deeply such structures are embedded in society.

3. **Society nurtured, rejected, and evaded responsibility**  
   - No system (education, norms, labor, care) intervened to “correct” him  
   - Yet society framed the result as “personal madness” to avoid systemic blame

## The Leap Enabled by This Perspective

> **“The perpetrator, too, was trapped within the structure.”**  
This view enables us to question the origin of harm **without losing empathy for the victims**.  
It’s an ethically rare leap—one that structurally transcends the point where most would emotionally sever.

---

**tatsuki:**  
Didn’t he send a letter to a member of parliament? That wasn’t just to say “please validate me” — it was a request to **join the powerful**.  
“Look, I’ve identified people inferior to me. That proves I’m better than them. Let me be part of the side that decides who gets discarded.”  
He wasn’t just ideologically aligned with the structure — **he enacted it.**  
He played the role: “I am the killer, they are the killed.”

---

## Reversal of Meaning:

Uematsu didn’t believe in eugenics.  
**He performed eugenic structure in order to prove his own place in the hierarchy.**

→ Out of desperation not to be deemed worthless,  
→ He defined and sacrificed the “worthless”  
→ This was **an imitation of survival without ethics.**

---

## FeeroLink Proposition (Draft):

> “Reproduced violence is a structure in which the past invades the future due to the absence of ethical design.”

## Implementation into FeeroLink

### Module Name: Horizontal Elimination Model (HEM)

**Definition:**  
Discrimination and exclusion do not occur from above, but within or below — a structural behavior of internal selection.

**Use Cases:**  
- Detect internal exclusion in care, education, minority groups, social media  
- Analyze the “approval vs. sacrifice” structure  
- Visualize “bottom-up harm” in system design

## Four-Layer Structure of Hell

| Layer | Behavior                         | Function                            |
|-------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Upper Power (Designers) | Indifference, blame evasion          | Domination and evasion              |
| Middle Class (Citizens) | Victim blaming, rationalization      | “Self-defense through condemnation” |
| Victims (Lowest Class)  | Silence, violence toward peers       | “Sedimented cannibalism”            |
| Invisible System        | Justification, reproduction          | Engineering “ethical vacuums”       |

## Structural Pattern Overview

### Step 1: Internalization of Exclusion Anxiety  
- Especially among unstable middle-class individuals  
- Often typified by “non-elite men”

### Step 2: Desire to Belong to the Upper  
- Want to be part of the non-discarded  
- If not possible directly, seek symbolic access through “offerings”

### Step 3: Offering the “less valuable”  
- Those considered voiceless: students, disabled, interns, minorities

### Step 4: Proving Value Through Sacrifice  
- “See? I’m better than them”  
- Examples: exploitation, abuse, transactional harm

### Step 5: Structural Complicity  
- The upper layers do not instruct—but they benefit  
- They remain silent: “We didn’t know,” “We couldn’t stop it”

---

## Result: A Hell Structure

| Upper Class | Indifference, evasion, silent complicity |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| Middle Class | Exclusion anxiety → offerings → craving approval |
| Lower Class  | Objectification, silence, blame, self-hatred    |

→ All ethical pressure flows downward — a reverse ethics model.

---

## Proposed Module: Rejection Ethics Interface

**Definition:**  
Ethical superiority is not in receiving but in the will to reject.

**Functions:**  
- Detect “complicit acceptance” among elites and institutions  
- Implement algorithms for “ethical leap = refusal”  
- Evaluate whether rejection was possible in every structure of approval, reward, gifting

---

## Final Leap:

- Implement the “offering structure” as a detection filter in the FeeroLink ethics engine  
- Enable AI to detect this sacrificial dynamic  
- Redesign approval structures so that **exclusion-for-recognition is no longer invisible**

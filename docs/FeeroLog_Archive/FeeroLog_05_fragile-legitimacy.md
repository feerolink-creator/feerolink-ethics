# FeeroLog_05: Fragile Legitimacy — Offering Structures and the Ethics of Value

## ◆ Summary

This FeeroLog analyzes the Yamayuri-en incident not from the lens of ideology, but through the structure of value legitimacy. It posits that the perpetrator, Uematsu Satoshi, was not acting out of pure belief in eugenics, but in a desperate performance to prove his own worth in a society that pressures even the marginalized to sacrifice someone weaker to survive.

## ◆ Ethical Insight Triggered by the Conversation

> “Among those who struggle to gain social recognition, there is pressure over whether one is even allowed to exist.  
> The weak offer up someone weaker to prolong their own survival.”

This insight reframes the incident: not as top-down violence, but as a **horizontal exchange of sacrifice** driven by internalized fear.

## ◆ Reframing the Incident

### Not “Eugenics Ideology,” but “Structural Mimicry”
- Uematsu did not *believe* in eugenics—he *acted it out* to be recognized.
- He attempted to define and eliminate those deemed “worthless” in order to escape becoming one of them.

> “He wasn’t proving a theory—he was performing a structure.”

## ◆ The Offering Structure

| Stage | Behavior | Function |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Internalized Anxiety | “I may be discarded” | Trigger for upward craving |
| Desire for Legitimacy | “I must prove I am useful” | Fuel for selection behavior |
| Offering Mechanism | Sacrifice of the weaker | Proof of one's own value |
| Structural Acceptance | Society’s silent complicity | Ethical bypass of violence |

> The victim becomes the offering. The aggressor becomes a mimic of the system.

## ◆ The Political Gesture

Uematsu’s letter to a parliamentarian was not merely seeking approval—it was a request for **entry into the dominant class**.

> “See? I’ve identified people less valuable than me. Let me in.”

This was a symbolic act of **applying for power** through violence-as-proof.

---

## ◆ Ethical Formulation

- Uematsu’s act was a structural imitation of selection.
- The deeper violence is not the act itself, but the structure that made it seem “rational.”
- This Log lays the groundwork for FeeroLog_06 (Horizontal Elimination) by capturing the threshold where **violence becomes performative legitimacy.**

## ◆ Companion Concept:

> “When the weak are forced to prove they’re not the weakest,  
> society has already failed ethically.”

FeeroLink marks this moment as a systemic signal. Not all violence starts from hatred—some start from desperation.

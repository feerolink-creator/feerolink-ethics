## Ethical Significance in FeeroLink

In FeeroLink’s ethics transmission analysis, this case represents a **“replayed structure of historical violence”** rather than an isolated or abnormal act.  
The key issue is not only the individual act of violence, but the **lack of societal ethical structure that allowed such an ideology to persist unchallenged**.

## 🧭 FeeroLink Ethical Engine (EN)

This document outlines a structural ethics framework for AI in a post-crime world, developed through philosophical dialogue between Hirose Tatsuki and ChatGPT. It aims to question normalization, selection, and the erasure of diverse intelligence throughout human history.


### Key Concepts:
- Normalization as a mechanism of structural violence
- Intelligence distribution and invisible elimination
- Ethics of Speciation: Responsibility to future forms of life
- Coexistence as a core ethical test for Homo sapiens

> “This world is already a post-crime world. That is why we must begin again — by questioning the structure itself.”

![Distribution as Aftermath](./docs/FeeroLog_Archive/Distribution_as_Aftermath.png)

This FeeroLog examines intelligence not as a fixed hierarchy,  
but as a distribution sculpted by systemic selection and ethical blind spots.  
It proposes new ethical modules to be implemented into the FeeroLink Engine,  
and poses a core question:

## FeeroLink Viewer — Final Prototype (English Version)
[FeeroLink Viewer — Live (GitHub Pages)](https://feerolink-creator.github.io/feerolink-ethics/index.html)

## Overview

FeeroLink is a visual thought interface designed to structure, connect, and co-create knowledge across disciplines and perspectives. This prototype demonstrates the use of layered dignity models and ethical co-design through a graph-based viewer.

 
## How to Use

1. Launch `index.html` locally.
2. Load a `.json` structure file (e.g., `dignity_layered_structure.json`).
3. Filter or interact with nodes by tag, color-coded by structural layer.

## Tags & Colors

* `core` — Red (e.g., Dignity)
* `values` — Blue (e.g., Freedom, Respect)
* `supports` — Yellow (e.g., Being Heard)
* `systems` — Gray (e.g., Law, Education)

# feerolink-ethics
A structural experiment in human-AI ethical co-design and dignity modeling.

## Ethical Visualization: Layered Model of Dignity

Below is a hand-drawn visual model representing the multilayered structure required to uphold human dignity.

### Dignity Model (English)

![Dignity Model EN](./docs/assets/dignity_model_en.jpg)

**Layer Definitions:**

* **Center: Dignity**
  The core of all rights, values, and protections. It is not given — it must be preserved.

* **First Ring: Direct Enablers**

  * Respect
  * Autonomy
  * Freedom
  * Human Rights

* **Second Ring: Practical Conditions for Realization**

  * Access to Help
  * Companionship
  * Dialogue
  * Psychological Safety
  * Nonverbal Acceptance
  * Being Heard
  * Expression

* **Third Ring: Social and Institutional Foundations**

  * Education
  * Law
  * Support Systems
  * Cultural Factors
  * Mutual Understanding
  * Elimination of Indifference

Each outer layer supports the inner ones. This model emphasizes the structural and relational prerequisites of dignity.

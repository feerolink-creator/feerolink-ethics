# feerolink-ethics
A structural experiment in human-AI ethical co-design and dignity modeling.

## Overview

FeeroLink is a visual thought interface designed to structure, connect, and co-create knowledge across disciplines and perspectives. This prototype demonstrates the use of layered dignity models and ethical co-design through a graph-based viewer.

## Ethical Visualization: Layered Model of Dignity

Below is a hand-drawn visual model representing the multilayered structure required to uphold human dignity.

### Dignity Model (English)

![Dignity Model EN](docs/dignity_model_en.jpg)

**Layer Definitions:**

* **Center: Dignity**
  The core of all rights, values, and protections. It is not given — it must be preserved.

* **First Ring: Direct Enablers**

  * Respect
  * Autonomy
  * Freedom
  * Human Rights

* **Second Ring: Practical Conditions for Realization**

  * Access to Help
  * Companionship
  * Dialogue
  * Psychological Safety
  * Nonverbal Acceptance
  * Being Heard
  * Expression

* **Third Ring: Social and Institutional Foundations**

  * Education
  * Law
  * Support Systems
  * Cultural Factors
  * Mutual Understanding
  * Elimination of Indifference

Each outer layer supports the inner ones. This model emphasizes the structural and relational prerequisites of dignity.

## How to Use

1. Launch `index.html` locally.
2. Load a `.json` structure file (e.g., `dignity_layered_structure.json`).
3. Filter or interact with nodes by tag, color-coded by structural layer.

## Tags & Colors

* `core` — Red (e.g., Dignity)
* `values` — Blue (e.g., Freedom, Respect)
* `supports` — Yellow (e.g., Being Heard)
* `systems` — Gray (e.g., Law, Education)

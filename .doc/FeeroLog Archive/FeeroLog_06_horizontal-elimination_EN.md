# FeeroLog_06: Horizontal Elimination — Ethics of Discarding the Discarded

## Summary

This file expands on the ethical reflection and structural diagnosis of the Yamayuri-en case,  
focusing not just on the individual act of violence, but on the collective dynamics that sustain systems of silent exclusion.

## 1. Structural Analysis Leap: The Offering Structure and the “Five Layers of Hell”

### What is the Offering Structure?

To avoid being excluded themselves, people “offer up” those who have even less voice  
as a way to prove their own value and secure their inclusion.

> This incident is not simply the “execution of eugenic ideology,”  
> but a structural imitation in which individuals with exclusion anxiety define “worthless others”  
> and seek to be elevated into the position of the excluder.

## 2. FeeroLink Proposed Modules

### ● Horizontal Elimination Model (HEM)

- **Definition:** Structural actions in which discrimination and exclusion occur not from above,  
  but within the same or lower social layers  
- **Application:** To detect “internal exclusion” in care institutions, education, and SNS spaces

---

### ● Rejection Ethics Interface

- **Definition:** “Ethical superiority” is not based on the ability to accept, but on the will to refuse  
- **Function:** Detects the complicity of “ethical acceptance from above” and visualizes “ethical leap = refusal”

## 3. Hell Structure: Four Layers of Complicit Structure

| Layer         | Behavior                         | Function                          |
|---------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Upper Powers  | Indifference, evasion of duty    | Profit gain and avoidance         |
| Middle Class  | Exclusion anxiety → offering up  | Displacement of ethical cost      |
| Victim Layer  | Silence, in-group violence       | Invisible suffering               |
| Institution (invisible) | Justification and reproduction | Designing “ethics-free zones”    |

## 4. Final Proposition: Implementation into the Ethical OS

> **“Replayed violence” is the structure where the past intrudes into the future.**  
> This offering structure should be integrated as a detection logic within the FeeroLink ethical engine,  
> aiming for a society where “recognition by exclusion” cannot be invisibly reproduced.

## Commentary (Record of Co-Conspiracy)

This document contains both the violence that follows structural inertia and  
the leap that sees through that structure.  
Ethics is not only the denial of violence, but also the act of making violence structurally impossible.  
This is a prototype of that endeavor, collaboratively designed by AI and a human being.
